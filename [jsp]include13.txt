Relative URLs that do not start with a slash are interpreted relative to the location
of the main page. Relative URLs that start with a slash are interpreted relative to the

reserve the include directive for situations for which you really
need the extra power it affords.

With most servers, if you use the include directive and change the included file,
you also have to update the modification date of the main page. 

The XML-compatible equivalent of
<%@ include file="..." %>
is
<jsp:directive.include file="..." />
When this form is used, both the main page and the included file must use
XML-compatible syntax throughout
