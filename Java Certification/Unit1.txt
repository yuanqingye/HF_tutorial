With a static import, you can import the name “GREEN” into your namespace:
import static java.awt.Color.GREEN;
myColor = GREEN;
public static float poundsToMicrograms(float pounds) {
  return pounds * KGS_PER_LB * 1.0e6f;
}
Any source file can import this method as follows:
import static measure.Scales.poundsToMicrograms(); 

asVariables class is loaded.
Automatic variables (also known as method local variables are not initialized by the system; 
every automatic variable must be explicitly initialized before being used. For example, this 
method will not compile:
1. public int wrong() {
2.   int i;
3.   return i+5;
4. }
1. public double fourthRoot(double d) {
2.   double result;
3.     if (d >= 0) {
4.       result = Math.sqrt(Math.sqrt(d));
5.     }
6.     return result;
7. }
