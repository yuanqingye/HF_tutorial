assignment goes from right to left
the cast is always allowed in compile time but may be checked in runtime

In fact, the test
Float.NaN != Float.NaN
and the equivalent with Double.NaN return true, as you might deduce from the fact that x == 
Float.NaN gives false even if x contains Float.NaN.
The most appropriate way to test for a NaN result from a calculation is to use the Float
.isNaN(float) or Double.isNaN(double) static method provided in the java.lang package.

The instanceof operator tests the class of an object at runtime.

Although it is not required by the Certification Exam, you might find it useful 
to know that you can determine whether an object is in fact an array without 
regard to the base type. You can do this using the isArray() method of the 
Class class. For example, this test returns true if the variable myObject refers to 
an array: myObject.getClass().isArray().

Although programmers usually apply these operators to the bits in integer variables, it is also 
permitted to apply them to Boolean operands.
