- parameterizes objects depending on the action they must perform
- specifies or adds in a queue and executes requests at different moments in time
- offers support for undoable actions (the Execute method can memorize the state and allow going back to that state)
- structures the system in high level operations that based on primitive operations
- decouples the object that invokes the action from the object that performs the action. Due to this usage it is also known as Producer - Consumer design pattern.

In this case the actors in the scenario are the following: The Client is the customer. He sends his request to the receiver through the waiter, who is the Invoker. The waiter encapsulates the command (the order in this case) by writing it on the check and then places it, creating the ConcreteCommand object which is the command itself. The Receiver will be the cook that, after completing work on all the orders that were sent to him before the command in question, starts work on it. Another noticeable aspect of the example is the fact that the pad for the orders does not support only orders from the menu, so it can support commands to cook many different items.



		$.each(response, function(index, value){
			var selected = value.selected=="" ? "" : "selected";
			content += "<option value=\"" + value.id + "\" " + selected +">" + value.name + "</option>";
			if( value.name == curProviderName ){
				curCalId = value.id;
			}
		});
		$("select#all_provider").html(content);
		$("select#all_provider").rebuildcustSelect();

Memento protects encapsulation and avoids exposing originator's internal state and implementation.

Using the memento pattern can be expensive depending on the amount of state information that has to be stored inside the memento object. In addition the caretaker must contain additional logic to be able to manage mementos.

According to Gamma et al, the Mediator pattern should be used when:
a set of objects communicate in well-defined but complex ways. The resulting interdependencies are unstructured and difficult to understand.
reusing an object is difficult because it refers to and communicates with many other objects.
a behavior that's distributed between several classes should be customizable without a lot of subclassing.

More than one object can handle a command
The handler is not known in advance
The handler should be determined automatically
It’s wished that the request is addressed to a group of objects without explicitly specifying its receiver
The group of objects that may handle the command must be specified in a dynamic way

The Client is, of course, the object that has generated the event, the request is the event and the handlers are the objects that can handle it.


The observer pattern is used when:
the change of a state in one object must be reflected in another object without keeping the objects tight coupled.
the framework we are writing needs to be enhanced in future with new observers with minimal changes.
Some Classical Examples:
Model View Controller Pattern - The observer pattern is used in the model view controller (MVC) architectural pattern. In MVC the this pattern is used to decouple the model from the view. View represents the Observer and the model is the Observable object.
Event management - This is one of the domains where the Observer patterns is extensively used. Swing and .Net are extensively using the Observer pattern for implementing the events mechanism.

The subscriber is the abstract class which is known to the publisher. The publisher doesn't know about concrete observers, it knows only about their abstraction.

When we have several subjects and observers the relations between them we'll become more complex. First of all are have a many to many relation, more difficult to manage directly. Second of all the relation between subjects and observers can contain some logic. Maybe we want to have an observer notified only when all the subjects will change their states. In this case we should introduce another object responsible (called ChangeManager) for the following actions:
to maintain the many to many relations between the subjects and their observers.
to encapsulate the logic of notify the observers.
to receive the notifications from subjects and delegate them to the observers(based on the logic it encapsulate)
Basically the Change Manager is an observer because if gets notified of the changes of the subject and in the same time is an subject because it notify the observers. The ChangeManager is an implemenation of the Mediator pattern.
