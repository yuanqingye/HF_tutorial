Start Mongodb:
1. Head over to the official download page and grab the binaries from the first row (the recommended stable version)
for your operating system of choice. For development purposes, you can pick either 32-bit or 64-bit.
2. Extract the archive (wherever you want) and navigate to the bin subfolder. Don’t execute anything just yet,
but know that mongod is the server process and mongo is the client shell - these are the two executables we’ll be
spending most of our time with.
3. Create a new text file in the bin subfolder named mongodb. config.
4. Add a single line to your mongodb.config: dbpath=PATH_TO_WHERE_YOU_WANT_TO_STORE_YOUR_DATABASE_FILES
. For example, on Windows you might do dbpath=c:\mongodb\data and on Linux you might do dbpath=/var/
lib/mongodb/data.
5. Make sure the dbpath you specified exists.
6. Launch mongod with the --config /path/to/your/mongodb. config parameter

after setup:
c:\mongodb\bin\mongod --config c:\mongodb\bin\mongodb. config
Then run this:
