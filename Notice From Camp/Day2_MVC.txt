Real-Time application, Claim Application - relied on Servlets - PM where we started to play around with this concept of Controller and Actions

fileUpload=new FileUploadUtil();
fileUpload.processRequest(_request);
fileUpload.printRequestParameters();
action=EHRActionEnum.valueOf((String) fileUpload.getParameter("ACTION_NAME"));

Map the HTTP Request
Perform some Action - invoke the BL
Prepare Response Parameter
Identify the next URL you will be heading to.
All the above only if the login is still valid 
If invalid login - then go to the logout page!

AbstractAction - Has two flavors - 
EHRAbstractAction - all EHR Related minor methods included and it implies you are going to URL next.
AbstractJSONAction - Which extends from AbstractEHRAction - but does not result URL instead the concrete class must override buildJSONArray - which will be returned to the client.

The abstract method buildJSONArray() is to be overriden.
The template method in this case is prepareresponsepatameter.
Notice getURL returns null - since you wrote the JSON string in the outputstream.

PLEASE DO NOT BE LAZY AND USE STRING REQUEST PARAMETER NAME - JUST TAKE A MINUTE TO DEFINE A PARAM ENUM OR IF YOU ARE DEALING WITH PROVIDER_ID, PRACTICE_ID CHANCES ARE THEY ARE ALREADY PRESENT IN EHRPARAMENUM!
