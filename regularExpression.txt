Via the $ you can refer to a group. $1 is the first group, $2 the second, etc.

Lets for example assume you want to replace all whitespace between a letter followed by a point or a comma. This would involve that the point or the comma is part of the pattern. Still it should be included in the result

// Removes whitespace between a word character and . or ,
String pattern = "(\\w)(\\s+)([\\.,])";
System.out.println(EXAMPLE_TEST.replaceAll(pattern, "$1$3")); 
This example extracts the text between a title tag.

// Extract the text between the two title elements
pattern = "(?i)(<title.*?>)(.+?)(</title>)";
String updated = EXAMPLE_TEST.replaceAll(pattern, "$2");
