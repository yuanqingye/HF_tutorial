The XML equivalent of <% Java Code %> is 
<jsp:scriptlet>Java Code</jsp:scriptlet>

Another use of scriptlets is to conditionally output HTML or other content that is not within any JSP tag;This behavior means that scriptlets need not contain complete Java statements and that code blocks left open can affect the static HTML or JSP outside the scriptlets.

For initialization and cleanup in JSP pages, use JSP declarations to override jspInit or jspDestroy, not init or destroy.

JSP declarations result in code that is placed inside the servlet class definition but outside the _jspService method. Since fields and methods can be declared in any order, it does not matter whether the code from declarations goes at the top or bottom of the servlet.

The XML equivalent of <%! Field or Method Definition %> is 
<jsp:declaration>Field or Method Definition</jsp:declaration>
