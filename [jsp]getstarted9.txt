• It is easier to write and maintain the HTML. Your static code is 
ordinary HTML: no extra backslashes, no double quotes, and no 
lurking Java syntax.
• You can use standard Web-site development tools. For example, 
we use Macromedia Dreamweaver for most of the JSP pages in the 
book. Even HTML tools that know nothing about JSP can be used 
because they simply ignore the JSP tags.
• You can divide up your development team. The Java 
programmers can work on the dynamic code. The Web developers can 
concentrate on the presentation layer. On large projects, this division 
is very important. Depending on the size of your team and the 
complexity of your project, you can enforce a weaker or stronger 
separation between the static HTML and the dynamic content.
